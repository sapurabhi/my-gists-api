# 🧹 Simple GitHub Gists API

This project implements a minimal HTTP web server in Java that interacts directly with the [GitHub Gists API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/gists/gists). It allows retrieving a public list of gists for any GitHub user.

> ✅ Designed for learning and demonstration purposes with a clean, framework-free architecture.

## ✅ Features

* 🔍 **Public Gists Retrieval** – Fetch public gists for a specified GitHub username.
* 🌐 **Minimal Web Server** – Uses Java’s native `com.sun.net.httpserver`.
* 💠 **Error Handling** – Gracefully handles 400/404/429/500 with JSON responses.
* 🧪 **Automated Testing** – JUnit 5 test suite included.
* 🐳 **Containerized** – Lightweight Docker image.
* ☕️ **Kubernetes-Ready** – Deployable via Helm on Minikube or any K8s cluster.
* 🔁 **CI/CD Ready** – Includes GitHub Actions workflow.
* 🪟 **Clean Build Artifacts** – Uses `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` to reduce noise.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

* Git
* Java JDK 17+
* Apache Maven 3.6+
* Docker Desktop
* Minikube
* kubectl
* Helm

---

## 🚀 Getting Started (Setup & Run)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EqualExperts-Assignments/equal-experts-mindful-mature-talented-sight-18baf3c8ca41.git
cd equal-experts-mindful-mature-talented-sight-18baf3c8ca41
```

### 2. Build the Application (Maven)

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Expected Output:

* Compiled Java classes
* JAR file in the `target/` directory
* All tests should pass with `BUILD SUCCESS`

---

### 3. Run the Application

You have two options to run the application: directly as a Java JAR or as a Docker container.

#### Option A: Run the Java Application Directly (JAR)

```bash
java -jar target/simple-github-gists-api-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Expected Output:

* Server started on port 8080
* Access health check at [http://localhost:8080/health](http://localhost:8080/health)
* Access Gists API at [http://localhost:8080/octocat](http://localhost:8080/octocat)
* Server will run until you stop it (e.g., Ctrl+C)

#### Option B: Run with Docker

Ensure the JAR is built (from Step 2).

```bash
docker build -t simple-gists-api:latest .
docker run -p 8080:8080 simple-gists-api:latest
```

Expected Output:

* Docker image is built
* Application runs inside container
* Accessible at same endpoints as direct run

To run in the background:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 simple-gists-api:latest
```

---

### 4. Local Development with Minikube and Helm

#### A. Install Minikube & Kubectl

Follow [Minikube installation guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

#### B. Start Minikube Cluster

```bash
minikube start
```

#### C. Build Docker Image Inside Minikube

```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
docker build -t simple-gists-api:latest .
```

#### D. Deploy with Helm

Create a Helm chart (e.g., `charts/simple-gists-api`). Example `values.yaml`:


Deploy using:

```bash
helm install simple-gists-api ./charts/simple-gists-api
```

#### E. Access Endpoints

```bash
minikube service simple-gists-api --url
```

Use the provided URL for curl/browser testing.

---

### 5. Cloud Deployment with GitHub Actions CI/CD

#### A. Configure Secrets

* `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
* `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`
* `KUBE_CONFIG_DATA` (Base64 encoded kubeconfig)

📦 GitHub Actions CI/CD
Once the GitHub Actions workflows are configured in your repository (under .github/workflows/), you can trigger them in several ways:

🔁 How to Trigger GitHub Actions Workflows
On Push: Push to main or any configured branch automatically.

Manually via GitHub UI (for workflow_dispatch enabled workflows):
Go to your repository on GitHub.
Click on the Actions tab.
Choose the workflow you want to run.
Click Run workflow (select branch if prompted).

Via API (Advanced):
You can use GitHub's REST API to trigger a workflow dispatch event using a personal access token (PAT).

---

## 🔧 Testing

### Automated Tests (Local)

```bash
mvn test
```

Expected Output:

```
T E S T S
Running GistServerTest
GistServerTest: Waiting for server to start on port 8081...
...
Health Check Response Status: 200
Health Check Response Body: OK
Octocat Gists Response Status: 200
...
NonExistentUser Response Status: 404
...
Root Path Response Status: 400
...
Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

### Manual API Testing (Local)

With the app running (JAR or Docker):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

Expected:

```
OK
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/octocat
```

Expected:

* JSON array of public gists

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8080/nonexistentuser123456789
```

Expected:

* HTTP 404 with `{"error": "GitHub user not found: nonexistentuser123456789"}`

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8080/
```

Expected:

* HTTP 400 with `{"message": "Please specify a GitHub username, e.g., /octocat"}`

## 🚧 API Endpoints

| Endpoint      | Method | Description                 |
| ------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| `/health`     | GET    | Health check endpoint       |
| `/{username}` | GET    | Fetch gists for GitHub user |

---

## 🌓 Management and Troubleshooting

* Logs printed to console (stdout)
* For Docker: use `docker logs <container_id>`
* For K8s: use `kubectl logs <pod>`

---

## 🌎 Best Practices Implemented

* Separation of concerns
* Consistent naming conventions
* Lightweight containers
* Health checks
* Clean and readable code
* Automated CI/CD pipeline

---

## 🧪 Further Enhancements (Extension Points)

* Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform)
* OAuth Token support for authenticated GitHub access
* Pagination and filtering for gists
* HTTPS support
* Request rate limiting
* Caching for performance
